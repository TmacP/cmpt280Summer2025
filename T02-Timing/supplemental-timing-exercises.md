# Question 1

Use the statement counting approach to determine the number of statements executed by the following Java method in the **worst case** (use the statement-counting approach). Assume that all methods and constructors called by the given method are Î˜(1).

```java
// Convert all lowercase characters in string s to upper case.
public String toUpperCase(String s) {
    StringBuilder t = new StringBuilder(s);

    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if(Character.isLowerCase(s.charAt(i))) {
            t.setCharAt(i, (char)(s.charAt(i) - 'a' + 'A'));
        }
    }

    return t.toString();
}
Solution:
Worst case is when the if-statement is always true. Let n=s.length()n=s.length(). Beginning with the inner loop:

    Number of statements in one loop iteration: 3

    Number of loop iterations: nn

    Total for the loop (including +1 when loop condition is false): 3n+13n+1

Total number of statements is the cost of the loop plus statements outside the loop:
1+3n+1+1=3n+3
